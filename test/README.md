Since this library is concerned with code generation that generates usable Dart code and since Dart does provide _eval_, the approach taken to testing here is as follows:

- A directory _scratch\_remove\_me_ is created for all code generated by the tests
- A set of tests that knows what to expect from that code generation is written (e.g. _expect\_test\_basic\_class.dart_)
- Since the structure of this setup was itself generated by ebisu - the running of all tests can be done by running _runner.dart_ or by running it from _../tools/hop\_runner.dart_. The tests recursively remove _scratch\_remove\_me_ at the start, then generate the code, then spawn the _expect\_.* tests to ensure what is generated is correct.
